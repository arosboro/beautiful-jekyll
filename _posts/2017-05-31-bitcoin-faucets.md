title: Bitcoin Faucets
subtitle: Earn small amounts of bitcoin every minute
---

The concept of a faucet is pretty popular.  It allows you to start earning bitcoin for free.
Provide your wallet address, and watch as your account accumulates at the rate of several
satoshi per minute.  This adds up, and can result in as much as 0.5 BTC daily if you use your
earnings to upgrade your faucet.

[BTCProMiner](https://btcprominer.life/181494) is a faucet I have been referred to recently.
Small amounts can add up, so this may be the place to start experimenting with bitcoin.
