Bitcoin is a digital currency that is peer to peer in nature.  This means that
you don't require a traditional financial institution to exchange funds.
Instead, digital currency is exchanged by sending amounts to an address and
and waiting for the bitcoin mining network to confirm that you indeed have the
coins and that the recipient should receive them.  This is done using an
an accounting method called triple ledger accounting, meaning there are three
sets of books recording the transaction (yours, the recipients, and the public
blockchain.)

The blockchain is public which means there is always a way to confirm that
funds were sent and received.  In this way you can participate in funding teams
 where the members send funds directly to each other, supporting their causes.
This does not require any third party.  Platforms for this exists as a tool
to make exchanges and track referrals, and transactions are direct from A -> B,
meaning you never have to worry about withdrawing funds or storing them with a
third party.

The amount of bitcoin that can be mined is fixed at 21000000, which is meant to
combat inflation.  It becomes increasingly difficult to reach this number as time
goes on.  As the population increases bitcoin will become relatively
scarce, potentially leading to increased demand.  However, bitcoins can be divided
in as small a unit as a hundredth of a millionth BTC which is known as a satoshi.

Other ways to earn bitcoin include, mining (using special hardware), referral networks,
 and trading (market speculation).
