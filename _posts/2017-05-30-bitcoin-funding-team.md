Bitcoin funding team is a platform that brings networks of people together to
support each other.  It's structured as a 2 x 5 matrix, membership requires a
monthly platform fee of .008 BTC, and an initial donation of .1 BTC.

*TLDR*  
You pay up .108 BTC to join, and start earning positive returns after
recruiting two people and paying an additional .2 BTC (covered by the new
members).  If interested, join my team using this [Bitcoin Funding Team Referral Link](https://bitcoinfundingteam.com/ref/arosboro)

Here are answers to some questions you may have about this type of marketing strategy:

---

### Question
Do I have to sign up referrals?

### Answer
You will need to make two referrals. They need to pay the same donation fee as
you did at first, and will have the same opportunities as you to sign up
referrals which are shared with your team.  The 2 x 5 matrix has five levels,
and starts with two referrals sending donations.  As each level increases, the
number of referrals doubles, giving the potential for 62 referrals
(2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32).

### Question
What additional costs are there?

### Answer
There is a .008 BTC platform fee every 60 days to
remain a member.  Donations are required based on your level on a monthly basis,
so it is important to refer members to your team.

The following donation amounts below are required to reach a higher level:

* Level 1: 0.10 BTC
* Level 2: 0.20 BTC
* Level 3: 0.40 BTC
* Level 4: 1.00 BTC
* Level 5: 2.00 BTC

For a total cost of 3.7 BTC to achieve the maximum rewards potential.  Once you
reach level 5, no further donations are required.

### Question
What are the payouts at each level?

### Answer
* Level 1: 0.20 BTC
* Level 2: 0.80 BTC
* Level 3: 3.20 BTC
* Level 4: 16.00 BTC
* Level 5: 64.00 BTC

For a total rewards potential of 84.2 BTC

Member's of your team will help you make referrals if their
slots are already filled.  This is called spillover.

### Question
When do I get access to my rewards?

### Answer
Funds are transferred to your wallet immediately as referrals join your team.
The referral is instructed to provide a transaction id to confirm that they have
sent the correct amount to your wallet, and then they become level 1 members.
