title: Bitcoin Mining
subtitle: Profitability vs Difficulty
---

Mining bitcoin used to be the most viable and easiest way to earn bitcoin.
However, due to the fundamental design of bitcoin, it becomes more difficult to
mine and earn coins over time.  In the early days mining could be done with a
normal desktop computer, then it required a high-end graphics card.
Eventually specialized chips called ASICs were introduced which increased the
number of coins mined and the difficulty to the point where it requires very
specialized hardware and a substantial electric bill to become profitable.

### Cloud Mining Contracts
If you don't want to own/operate your own hardware, you can find a contract to have bitcoin mined and then transferred to you.
Typically the mining calculator below will still apply, but instead of electricity and hardware costs, factor in the contract costs.

Unless you join a mining pool, the odds of solving a block are low.  Even as a member of a mining pool,
you normally don't solve the block yourself, some one else is lucky enough to solve it and shares the reward with the pool members.

### DIY Hardware Miners

of bitcoin mining hardware.

### Necessary Data Points to Calculate Profitability
* Hash Rate (GH/s) - The rate at which a calculation can be made to compute part of a block
* Power Consumption (Watts) - The amount of power your mining rig uses
* Cost per KW/h - Usually the cost of your utility bill
