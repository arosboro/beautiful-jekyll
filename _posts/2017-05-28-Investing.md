subtitle: Can you earn bitcoin by trading?

To be honest, this depends on your awareness of the market and luck.  Trading bitcoin
vs value of traditional currency or other digital currency is similar to forex.
Due the volatile nature of bitcoin it seems like the best option is to buy and hold.
Some may sell a certain percentage of their holdings if the value starts to fall drastically, and then repurchase that
amount or more when they think the trading value has reached its low point.  This can be risky,
typically events causing uncertainty or lack of faith in bitcoin will cause a drop in price.
however, historically the price has always recovered at a higher value after the incident.
